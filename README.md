  broadcast-like technology unlike Google and their Play Store and Apple and
  their Appstore), would that be sufficient enough to ensure the software update
  process is no longer be utilised as an attack-vector against a particular

* What happens when a company cannot comply to a warrant or a Notice because of
  technical design (i.e don't hold any keys or data)

* Can the government walk up to me, demand I create a backdoor in my work

* Are we able to handle any European data in Australia as it could be a
  potential violation of GPDR

* When a weakness is discovered, what happens when it's fixed by someone not
  under a Notice

* What happens when to target a user, we would have to decrypt for all users

* What happens if we do client-side encryption - do we have to modify the
  decryption to target an individual?
	* What are the ramifications if we are caught if we can't target the payload
	  to the individual and so have to serve it to everyone (think CDN)?

	* What if you can't genuinely comply because of external constraints or the
	  risk of disclosure

* If we are served with a TCN, TAR, or TAN, is it legal to engage a lawyer, or
  does the non-discloseure provisions include attorney-client privilege?

* If I am served a TCN, but the execution of it would breach GDPR or HIPPA,
  what do I do?

* Who can issue warrents and Notices

* A technical person reviewing code/config/state finds software/configuration
  that they believe may be the result of a TCN, or may be a malicious backdoor.
	If they communicate information about what they have found to another person,
  can they be in violation of the rules of a TCN they are unaware of?
	* (Context for question: concern around chilling effects the law may have on
	  reporting/discussing non-AAbill backdoor

* How will this interact with the consumer law?
	* If we sell a product labelled as secure and we're forced to add a flaw into
		that security does the customer have a right to refund under the consumer
    law as unfit for purpose?
	* Could we then have cause for the government to cover any financial losses
	  related to this as the customers issue comes from the governments order?
